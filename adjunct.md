The instructor is neither a permanent nor a full-time employee of the university although the instructor has taught nearly every semester at Carleton University since Winter 2009. This includes having taught ten different courses, from the first year to fourth year level. My situation is not atypical, but increasingly normal. This should be a cause for concern, especially in the context of a course called "Social Justice and Human Rights."

Instructors such as myself are hired on a per course basis and such hirings are deemed to be "part time." In addition to being part time employees, we are also deemed to be "temporary" employees. In other words, we live in four month (i.e., one semester long) increments with no guarantee of any further employment.

Instructors such as myself are called sessionals (because they are hired on a per session basis), CIs (an acronym for "contract instructor" which serves to distinguish us from full-time, permanent academic staff) or, primarily in the United States, adjuncts (which means, per the dictionary, "A thing added to something else as a supplementary rather than an essential part.") It is inappropriate to call a contract instructor "Professor," even as an honorific. 

As contract instructors we do not have guaranteed access to an office, computers, and administrative support. Admittedly, office space is assigned to us and office space can be better or worse depending upon the department in question, but no contract instructor receives private, secure office space. Most often, there is one office for all the contract instructors in the department to share.

In the eyes of the university and, to be fair, Carleton University is not an exception in this regard, we are, literally, "supplementary rather than essential part" of post-secondary education. However, this perception does not map on to reality: a significant majority of courses are taught by "supplementary rather than essential" instructors. Consider what this means in terms your education. 

The Department of Law and Legal Studies is offering 5.5 in classroom credits during the Summer 2012 semester. 4.0 of those credits (73%) are being taught by "supplementary rather than essential" instructors; 1.5 of those credits (17%) are being taught by "essential rather than supplementary" instructors. Of the 6.0 credits being offered online or by video, 4.5 (75%) are being taught by "supplementary rather than essential" instructors; 1.5 (25%) of those credits are being taught by "essential rather than supplementary" faculty. (It should not be ignored that more virtual courses are offered than real courses.) In other words, part-time, inessential instructors are offering 73.9% of credits during the Summer 2013 semester. These numbers are not atypical at Carleton University or, indeed, for most universities in Canada. 

Please keep in mind that as a part time employee, I am not "on call" twenty-four hours a day and, thus, will not immediately respond to emails. As a part time employee, I am not allocated enough paid hours to adequately prepare for and deliver this course; thus I am not able to hold office hours. As a part time employee, I am not paid to advise or write letters of recommendation.

Compared to full time, permanent faculty, contract instructors are underpaid, receive no benefits (such as health or dental insurance), have no job security, and other basic elements of fair labour practices.
